# Changelog

## v3.0.0 (Unreleased)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `fuzzySearch` params have been swapped, so now its `fuzzySearch(needle, haystack)` instead
- Renamed `removeAt` to just  `remove`
- Renamed `replaceAt` to just `update`
- `flatten` has been removed, consider using `concat` and `concatMap` instead
- `uniq` now only looks for an array, use `uniqBy` in order to use the old functionality
- Removed `clone` since `assign` is essentially the same thing with more capabilities
- Function params passed to `juxt` should now be contained within a single array
- Changed the return of `mean` so it returns 0 instead of `NaN` for bad arguments passed in
- `isEmpty` now handles values such as `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `Booleans` it will return `true` for ALL of these
- `empty` no longer throws an error for non "emptyables". Instead it returns `undefined`

### Fixed

- Addressed copy and paste errors for `prepend` docs
- Addressed several documentation errors

### Improved

- Some more tweaks to internal documentation scripts
- Replaced `ava` and converted back to `tape` (Yay!)
- `max` now uses `last` internally instead of `nth` should improve is seperate build size/performance
- `min` now uses `first` internally instead of `nth` should improve is seperate build size/performance
- Removed `functionName` internal since it's no longer being used
- Improved build size of `isEqual` by removing impossible logic
- Added onto `identical` documentation with more examples
- Re-wrote `assign` for better optimization,

### New

- Added `path` function to safely navigate objects that may or may not have properties
- Added `sift` function which works a lot like `filter` but with `Object` data types
- Added `whole` function which works a lot like `every` but with `Object` data types
- Added `any` function which works a lot like `some` but with `Object` data types
- Added `insert` function which inserts a data value into a specified index of an array
- Added `height` function which works like length, however it handles object data types
- Added `gets` function which goes through an object to pull values requested in an array
- Added `plan` function which takes a schema object of functions to apply to a matching object of data
- Added `gt` function which compares the passed in values to determine if one is greater than the other
- Added `gte` function which compares the passed in values to determine if one is greater than or equal to the other
- Added `lt` function which compares the passed in values to determine if one is less than the other
- Added `lte` function which compares the passed in values to determine if one is less than or equal to the other
- Added `when` function which uses a logic function to trigger an action function if the arguments are true
- Added `concat` function which concats the values of an array to a new array
- Added `concatMap` function which applies a function to the values of an array and concats them
- Added `compact` function which takes an array and removes all falsy values from it
- Added `uniqBy` function which does what the original `uniq` was built to do
